# Online Music Store Analysis

In this project, we will examine sales from a fictional online music store Chinook. We will explore a database that contains tables of information about the employees, customers, and music involved in Chinook's business. We will examine trends and look for opportunities for Chinook to improve its business.

We will use a combination of SQL queries, graphs, and a map to examine the data.
